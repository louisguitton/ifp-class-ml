PVLIB Python is a community supported tool that provides a set of
functions and classes for simulating the performance of photovoltaic
energy systems. PVLIB Python was originally ported from the PVLIB MATLAB
toolbox developed at Sandia National Laboratories and it implements many
of the models and methods developed at the Labs. More information on
Sandia Labs PV performance modeling programs can be found at
https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/. We collaborate with the PVLIB MATLAB project,
but operate independently of it.

We need your help to make pvlib-python a great tool!
